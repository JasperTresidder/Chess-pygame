<h3>Pygame Chess — play, analyze, and review your games</h3>

<p>
This is a full chess game built with <strong>Pygame</strong>, featuring multiple ways to play and a set of tools to help you learn from your games.
Play <strong>Player vs AI (Stockfish)</strong>, <strong>Player vs Player</strong>, or <strong>AI vs AI</strong>, then jump into <strong>Review</strong> and <strong>Analysis</strong> modes to explore positions, engine lines, and your own variations.
</p>

<h4>Key features</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>All standard chess rules</strong> (legal moves, castling, en passant, promotion, check/checkmate, etc.).</li>
	<li><strong>Stockfish AI</strong> with configurable strength (great for practice).</li>
	<li><strong>Chess clock</strong> with increments + clear on-board clock display.</li>
	<li><strong>Fast move browsing</strong>: use Left/Right to step through moves quickly (holding the keys scrubs through positions).</li>
	<li><strong>Clickable move list</strong> with current-move highlight (jump to any position instantly).</li>
	<li><strong>Review mode</strong>: step through a finished game and explore engine suggestions + top lines (MultiPV).</li>
	<li><strong>Variations</strong>: add your own lines during review/analysis and navigate them easily.</li>
	<li><strong>Analysis mode</strong>: freely explore a position without UI freezing (engine work runs asynchronously).</li>
	<li><strong>Save / load analysis</strong> (JSON) so you can return to your work later.</li>
	<li><strong>PGN saving</strong> for played games.</li>
	<li><strong>Pre-moves</strong> (useful vs AI for faster play).</li>
	<li><strong>Resizable board</strong> and a clean 60/40 layout in review/analysis so panels never overlap the board.</li>
	<li><strong>Settings</strong> menu including a <strong>sound on/off</strong> toggle.</li>
</ul>
